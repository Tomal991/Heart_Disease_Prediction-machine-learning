# Heart_Disease_Prediction-machine-learning
This is a Heart_Disease_Prediction project using Machine Learning approach.I have implemented both Random Forest classifier and Decision Tree classifier method/technique to do the project.Finally found the accuracy score for Random Forest is 71 percent and for Decision Tree it is 63.3 percent.It can be considered as a good accuracy.

*Implemented by train_test_split method.
*if cardiac is 0 then no heart disease
*if 1 then positive heart disease.
